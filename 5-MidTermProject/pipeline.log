Question: What is Rag ?

Answer:

2025-11-30 13:56:26,632 INFO: Model Response:
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines retrieval of relevant information from external sources with generative AI models to produce more accurate and contextually informed responses. In this approach, the AI retrieves pertinent data or documents from a knowledge base and then uses a generative model to synthesize a coherent answer, enhancing the quality and factuality of the output.
