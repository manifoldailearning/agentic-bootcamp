Context: Multi-agent System: An architecture involving two or more specialized AI agents that communicate and collaborate under a supervisory agent or orchestration framework to complete a single, large workflow.

Reasoning: The cognitive process, often driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), where the AI agent draws conclusions, makes decisions, and formulates a plan of action based on the perceived information and its overall goal.

Orchestration: The coordination and management of multiple AI agents, each often specializing in a different role or sub-task, to work collaboratively and synchronously towards a single, complex objective.
