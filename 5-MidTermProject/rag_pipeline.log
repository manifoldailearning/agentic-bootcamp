Context: Agentic AI: An advanced AI system capable of autonomously setting sub-goals, reasoning, planning, and executing multi-step actions using various tools to achieve a higher-level objective with minimal human oversight.

AI Agent: A fundamental software entity that continuously perceives its environment, reasons about the information, and takes actions to achieve specific goals. They are the building blocks of agentic AI.

Autonomy: The core characteristic of Agentic AI, referring to the system's ability to operate and make decisions independently without continuous human intervention or step-by-step guidance.
