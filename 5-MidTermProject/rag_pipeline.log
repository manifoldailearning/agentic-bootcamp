- An SSN is a nine-digit number formatted as XXX-XX-XXXX.
- The first three digits (area number) historically represented the geographic region of issuance.
- The middle two digits (group number) range from 01 to 99.
- The last four digits (serial number) range from 0001 to 9999.

For example, a pattern might look like: 123-45-6789.

Context: Human in the Loop (HITL): A safety and governance practice where an autonomous AI agent is designed to seek human review or approval before executing actions that are classified as high-risk or high-impact.

Action / Tool Use: The ability of an AI agent to execute a decision by interacting with external systems, databases, APIs, or software tools to perform a task in the real world.

Reasoning: The cognitive process, often driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), where the AI agent draws conclusions, makes decisions, and formulates a plan of action based on the perceived information and its overall goal.
